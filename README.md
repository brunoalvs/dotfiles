# Bruno's dotfiles

These are config files to set up a system that way I like it. It's a work in progress, so it's not perfect yet.


## Windows Requirements

To install the dotfiles on Windows, you need have the winget installed. Its a package manager for Windows that comes with Windows 10 
- [winget](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/)

## Installation

```bash
git clone
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```
