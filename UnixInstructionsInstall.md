# Unix Post Install [W.I.P]

## Features

- [ ] Homebrew
- [ ] iTerm2
- [ ] Visual Studio Code
- [ ] z - Directory jumper (zoxide)

## Getting Started

You can install all the packages automatically using the file `install.sh` in the root of the repository.

In order for the script to be directly callable, you have to set the executable flag, like this:
```bash
chmod +x ./install.sh
```

Now we can run the script:
```bash
# on MacOS
sh ./install.sh
```
```bash
# on Linux
./install.sh
```
